# Migoi Films - Nature and Wildlife Photography

This is a launch landing page for Migoi Films, a nature and wildlife inspired photography and conservation effort.

## About Migoi Films

Migoi Films is dedicated to capturing the beauty of nature and wildlife, with a current focus on India. Our work highlights the incredible biodiversity of regions like the Himalayas, the Northeast, and the Konkan Coast. Through our photography, we aim to inspire conservation and a deeper appreciation for the natural world.

## How to Use

This is a simple, static landing page built with HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript. It is designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages.

### Customization

1.  **Content:** Edit `index.html` to change the text content.
2.  **Styling:** Modify `style.css` to change the look and feel of the website. You can change colors, fonts, and layout.
3.  **Images:** Replace the placeholder images in the `index.html` with your own photography. The current placeholders are from [lorempicsum.com](https://picsum.photos/). You will want to create an `images` directory and add your photos there, then update the `src` attributes in the `<img>` tags.
4.  **Scripts:** `script.js` contains minimal JavaScript. You can add more interactivity here if you wish.

### Deploying to GitHub Pages

1.  Make sure your code is in a GitHub repository.
2.  Go to your repository's **Settings**.
3.  In the left sidebar, click on **Pages**.
4.  Under **Source**, select the branch you want to deploy from (usually `main` or `master`).
5.  Choose the `/(root)` folder.
6.  Click **Save**.
7.  Your website will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>/`. It might take a few minutes to become live.
